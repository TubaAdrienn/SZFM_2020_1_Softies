# Simple Joke Site

## 1. System goals
One of our goals regarding the system is to keep it 7/24 available for users to access. The design of the portal is going to be responsive in order to make it possible to use our system, not decreasing in quality, on different size of devices' screen. One of the basic features of the system is the ability to react to users' activity. One of those are clicking and typing in order to fulfill the desire of the user. Other features are the ability to switch between menu items, search between categories and filter the data the user is looking for. Retrieving the jokes are going to happen with the usage of an API. This API generates the jokes randomly so the website displays randomly generated jokes on the main page.

## 2. Not system goals
* Administration of users
* Enable registration
* Enable log in
* Enable user to post content on the site
* Displaying animations and videos on the site
* Subscribing to newsfeed
* Unavailability

## 3. Project plan
First and foremost the most important part of working in a group is dividing responsibility and different kind of tasks fairly and evenly. We are aware that we have different kind of strength when it comes to different parts of development so we strive for equality: two people of our group will be responsible for the visual design of our webpage and two people will be in charge of creating the backend code. It doesn't mean total separation, tasks will be discussed thoroughly when questions arise.

Positions:
 * Anna Egyed - Backend (JavaScript)
 * Adrienn Tuba - Backend (JavaScript)
 * Csaba Szilágyi - Frontend (HTML/CSS)
 * Mátyás Fenyvesi - Frontend (HTML/CSS)

Our schedule is already started:
* We have already discussed the plans and requirement scpecifications beforehand, we cleared up what the aim of the website is. 
* The next step was to create the function specification where we cleared up the functional details of the website and anything that needed clarification.
* The current step is creating a system design where further functional and systemic details should be clarified.
* And the last milestone is the actual programming and testing of the product

## 4. Business process model
 Opening the website results in the home page which gives the visitor the default jokes from any categories and the navigation bar will offer different kind of option to filter the content. 
* Home: The Home button will navigate us back to the default home page where jokes will be displayed randomly unless a category is chosen. Also on the home page the Joke of the Day will be placed which stays the same all day. This is the main part of the website, this is where you can choose your favourite jokes and save them or just have a good laugh on a rainy day.
* Categories: The categories tab will give the opportunity to filter the jokes by chosing one of the possible categories. 
* The Gallery will contain pictures of memes that could also entertain the visitors of this website, since nowadays memes seem to be just as popular as written jokes.
* The Your Liked Jokes tab will give you the opportunity to take a look at your liked jokes so you can always visit the website again and get back your saved items.
* Searchbar: In case you forgot to save a joke or you just look for something particular, there is an option to search for that joke amongst the others by words.

## 7. Physical environment

**Purchased software components and external systems:** The only external system we use is the [RapidAPI's](http://rapidapi.com/) [JokeAPIv2](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/#joke-type) which is a RESTful API that serves the jokes. It can be used freely.

**Frontend:**
* Visual Studio Code - HTML and CSS, offers a great deal of different kind of tools and extensions
* Sublime Text 

**Backend**
* Visual Studio Code - Extensions for JavaScript (ES6), Live Server

**Other Environments**
* Mozilla - Web Browser
* Google Chrome - Web Browser
* Safari - Mac OS X web browser


## 8. Abstract domain model
* Domain specification, concepts
* Abstract components and their relationship

## 9. Architectural design
**Main Components of the design**

**Front End**
* Web Browser
* Mobile Browser
* The User Interface, the visual design will take place at this front

**Middle**
* Application server
* Web server

**Back End**
* REST API

The Website will follow the client-server model which means that different kind of clients can run at the same time and the server will be able to process their requests. It requires Internet access.

## 10. Database design
This application doesn't use MySQL or anything that could be considered traditional database. It retrieves its data from a WebAPI and works with its content and saves the liked jokes to a local storage that is a readonly property of the document, in this case browser, visitors open the webpage. So everyone can save in and read from it locally without maintaining a database.

The API doesn't directly send data though, it works with promises that sends arrays with different kind of informations. A typical response from the API looks like this: 

    {joke: {…}}
    joke:
        category: "Programming"
        error: false
        flags: {nsfw: false, religious: false, political: false, racist: false, sexist: false}
        id: 2
        joke: "A guy walks into a bar and asks for 1.4 root beers.↵The bartender says "I'll have to charge you extra, that's a root beer float".↵The guy says "In that case, better make it a double.""
        lang: "en"
        type: "single"
        __proto__: Object
     __proto__: Object

According to the URL the fetch request uses, filtering is possible on the available data by blocking out flags or choosing categories.

Saving the data will use the localStorage gives an oppotunity to save a string with an ID to retrieve it later. The ID can be anything, it will treat is as a string. The actual value can be anything: the magic of modern technology and JavaScript can achieve the power of saving even an array or an object. In our case a simple string will be enough.

## 11. Implementation design:
* Presistence classes (dao.js, util.js)
* Business logic classes (uicontroller.js, app.js)
* Client-side classes (html/css - homepage.html, gallery.html, favjokes.html)

## 12. Test design

## 13. Installation design
* Have an electrical device that is functional and capable of accessing the Internet (mobile, PC, etc..)
* If don't have an operating system, then need to install any of them. (Windows, Ubuntu, etc..)
* Internet access
* Download/install any web browser
* Type the URL of the page in the title bar
## 14. Maintenance design
