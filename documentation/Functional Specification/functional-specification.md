## System goals
The system goal is to provide a website that display jokes that belong to different kind of categories for visitors to binge trough.
* One goal is that visitors should be able to search and filter the jokes based on their categories
* It should be possible to save favourite jokes locally that could be displayed later on the screen
* Filtering not-safe-for-work content should also be possible to achieve a child-friendly website
* A part of the website should display the Joke of the Day, which should stay the same the whole day, but should be generated randomly each day

## Not system goals
* User registration
* Displaying animations, videos 
* Sending own jokes
* Saving jokes to a database

## Scenarios
Opening the website should result in the main screen displaying which should contain the tabs to choose from the categories and the place to display the jokes. On default it should display random jokes. On one side the Joke of the Day should take place, which should not change while navigating on the website.
Options:
* Under the jokes, there should be a button. By clicking on it, a new joke should be queried from the WebAPI.
* Choosing the category results in only displaying the jokes that belong in that category
* A button should be displayed that controls whether the website displays the NSFW content or not
* Saving favourite jokes locally by clicking a button in the joke's displaying box
