## 3. Current situation description
We are a cheerful organization of young web developers, with a goal in mind to put a smile on the faces of as many people as possible with our projects. In our rushing modern world people tend to get lost in their boring everyday life, so we want to make our visitors' everydays a little brighter. At the moment, no one of our acquaintances have a favorite joke site, and jokes only go the round.

## 4. Desired system description
We want to give a web appearance to the contents stored in newspapers, comics, Facebook posts and text files. With the constant development of technology, these physical contents (comics, newspaper etc.) slowly start to disappear. Nowadays most people have mobile phones, which has become almost essential to the everyday life. Keeping up with the current technology, we want to brighten your mood if you have boring moments, with a help of just a few clicks or taps on our website. Visitors could spend their time here and creating a good atmosphere for themselves or others. The website has to be easy to access and navigate for every user. If possible, it should have a responsive interface. The website should be easy to maintain. It should be possible to filter the content to make it child-friendly or not. It has to contain a search bar so that people can find jokes for their own preferences.
