				We are a cheerful organization of young web developers, with a goal in mind to put a smile on the faces of as many people as possible with our projects.
                In our rushing modern world people tend to get lost in their boring everyday life, so we want to make our visitors' everydays a little brighter.

				We want to give a web appearance to the different kind of jokes which you can usually find in newspapers, comics or in Facebook posts in one place.
                With the constant development of technology, these physical contents (comics, newspaper etc.) slowly start to disappear. 
				Nowadays most people have mobile phones, which has become almost essential to the everyday life. 
				Keeping up with the current technology, we want to brighten your mood if you have boring moments, with a help of just a few clicks or taps on our website. 
				Visitors could spend their time here and creating a good atmosphere for themselves or others.
